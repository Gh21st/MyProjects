My programming projects


Hi! I am Isaac Boteler-a Computer Engineering and Math undergraduate student at University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

I am using my little freetime between classes to code projects to familarize myself with various coding languages. 
As is I have experience in Java, Cpp, Verilog (little), Matlab (little) and Python (little). 

I have a linkedin, it is:

As these are independent projects I do not hold myself to as much rigour as in a professional or academic setting.
Many of these projects are built to explore different ways to structure code for the optimization of speed, scalability, reusability and/or storage.

Questions, criticism or feedback can go to

Thanks for reading
Have a good day
Isaac Boteler
